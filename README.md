## Project Overview
We are designing a prototype for a secure, in-house chatbot system with the focus on compliance, security, data privacy, and protecting intellectual property that are typically at risk with AI chatbots. Our proposed solution will include research, a detailed project report, and a final deliverable of a simple, working prototype. If possible, we wanted it to have multilingual capabilities.
